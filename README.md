# Data Compression
### this is a hobby project where i impelement the basic ideas and algorithm in the field of data compression
### this is mostly a way for me to learn this stuff so feel free to fix any mistakes or provide any optimization to the code...


## Useful links

#### great for overall data compression algorithms
